## Features
## Automated Reporting

The Automated Reporting feature leverages advanced technologies to streamline the process of generating customized reports from the database. This functionality enhances data-driven decision-making by providing users with tailored insights. Here's how it works:

### OpenAI API Integration

- The system integrates with the OpenAI API, a powerful language model, to assist in report generation.
- Users can specify their reporting requirements using natural language queries.
- The OpenAI API processes these queries and generates detailed reports based on the database's content and structure.

### Chat-Based History Storage

- To ensure traceability and historical context, the system adopts a chat-based approach to data interactions.
- Conversations between users and the system are logged and stored as chat history.
- This chat history serves as a record of user requests, queries, and interactions with the database.

### Customized Reports

- Users can request specific types of reports, such as performance summaries, sales projections, or customer insights.
- The OpenAI-powered system translates these requests into database queries and retrieves relevant data.
- Customized reports are then generated, incorporating charts, graphs, and textual summaries for easy understanding.

### Data Slicing and Dicing

- The system enables users to slice and dice data to view it from various angles and depths.
- Users can refine their reports by applying filters, sorting data, and drilling down into specific details.
- This feature empowers users to explore data comprehensively and gain insights from different perspectives.

### Accessibility and Collaboration

- Automated reports can be accessed by authorized users from a central dashboard.
- Collaboration features allow multiple team members to review and discuss reports within the system.
- Notifications and sharing options facilitate seamless communication and decision-making.

The combination of OpenAI's natural language processing capabilities and chat-based history storage ensures that users can effortlessly interact with the database and obtain valuable insights through automated reporting.
